Grew up in Siberia, Russia, I entered Novosibirsk State University to study fundamental physics.


During this time, I found machine learning to be an interesting subject and a hobby.
Then I started working as an NLP data scientist on a chatbot project in a fintech company.
My R&D department also conducted experiments and developed credit scoring models and marketing ML models.


Throughout the years, I've studied and worked in multiple branches of Data Science,
including recommender systems while working at Zvuk, a Russian audio streaming service,
and MLOps engineering during almost two years of experience as a technical consultant at GlowByte Consulting.
Now I'm gaining even more technical expertise in high-load and big data practices for
recommender systems while working at Wildberries, the biggest Russian online retailer.
