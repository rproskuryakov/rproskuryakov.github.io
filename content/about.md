Hey, I'm Rodion.

I'm interested in:
- MLOps
- Recommender Systems
- Information Retrieval
- Math

As an MLOps Engineer with over 5 years of experience,
I have had the opportunity to contribute to a wide range of projects,
including those focused on NLP, machine learning engineering, and consulting/audit.
Currently, I work at Wildberries, the largest online retailer in Russia,
where I apply my expertise to drive innovative solutions 
and optimize machine learning operations.

In my spare time I enjoy swimming.

Key Skills & Technologies: `Python`, `SQL`, `FastAPI`, `Triton Inference Server`, `ONNX`, `Airflow`, `CI/CD`, `Docker`, `RecSys`, `K8S`, `Business Process Analysis`.
