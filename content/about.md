Hey, I'm Rodion.

I'm interested in:
- Model inference
- MLOps/LLMOps
- ML systems reliability
- Computer Architecture
- Math

I'm an MLOps Engineer with more than 5 years of experience. 
I work at Wildberries which is the biggest online-retailer in Russia. 
I've worked on plenty of projects including NLP, ML Engineering and Consulting/Audit projects. 

In my spark time I enjoy swimming.
