# History of Nvidia Professional GPUs Microarchitectures

This is the second post in the GPU Architecture Series. The first post covering basics 
of GPUs architectures overall and particular features of Nvidia GPUs
for deep learning applications. This post will tell you the story behind Nvidia professional
GPUs. We will see what microarchitectures Nvidia invented, how they are related to one another, 
and what optimizations each microarchitectures has compared to the previous generation.
