## Introduction

A/B-testing has become the main tool for almost any machine learning model online evaluation method. 
But there is another tool for search ranking and recommender systems in particular, interleaving. 
Somehow it is not mentioned enough despite its big advantages over A/B-testing in multiple cases.

## Motivation

Cola Example

## A/B-test disadvantages 

- Variance 
- Multiple groups
- Bad model affecting users
